Some state laws require payday lenders to offer extended repayment plans to borrowers who have trouble repaying their payday loan. These laws vary by state, and may or may not permit or require a fee for using a repayment plan.

If your state requires a lender to offer an extended repayment plan, you may be able to get additional time to repay your loan without any additional costs or fees. This means that you can pay off your loan rather than borrowing again, incurring more fees, and getting further behind in debt.

If your state does not offer this, some lenders may still allow you to take an extended repayment plan, which is different than a rollover. You should ask your lender about this option if youâ€™re having trouble paying back the loan.
